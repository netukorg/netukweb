# About NetUK 1

The first NetUK conference will take place at [IET London: Savoy Place](https://savoyplace.theiet.org/). This is an in-person conference, however the event will be streamed live.

Our conferences are a place where like-minded professionals can meet, share best practices and new innovations, learn from challenges and success stories, share knowledge with new entrants into the networking community, and forge new connections.

## Who Should Attend?

Anyone who is an active participant in Internet operations and the peering community at large. We particularly encourage new entrants, junior engineers/ team members and students to join.

See the list of [current participants >>](https://indico.netuk.org/event/1/registrations/participants)

## How to Register

Registration is open and tickets are available through Pretix.
There are two types of tickets available;

- General tickets: for all participants except students. The tickets are discounted and available at £50 per individual.
- Student tickets: reserved for students and free of charge.

# Submit a Presentation

The NetUK PC are looking for in-person content. Proposals on any subject relevant to networking and interconnection are welcome, both technical and non-technical. Perhaps tell us about a new technology you're implementing. If you’ve been working on a project, solved a problem, or are thinking about a challenge, bring it to NetUK!

NetUK is run on a non-profit basis and is not in a position to reimburse expenses or time for speakers at its meetings, however, we do provide an event ticket for accepted speakers.
