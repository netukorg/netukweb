# About NetUK 1

The first NetUK conference took place on 8th and 9th of July, at [IET London: Savoy Place >>](https://savoyplace.theiet.org/).

Our conferences are a place where like-minded professionals can meet, share best practices and new innovations, learn from challenges and success stories, share knowledge with new entrants into the networking community, and forge new connections.
